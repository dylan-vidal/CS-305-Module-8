Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

The client Artemis Financial is a mid-sized financial services firm. The company needed to address security vulnerabilities in its software to protect sensitive financial data and ensure compliance with industry standards.

What did you do well when you found your client's software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company's overall well-being?

The actions I took to find the security vulnerabilities was a comprehensive security audit by performing a thorough review f the software systems to identify potential security weaknesses and using automated vulnerability scanning tools and collaboration efforts by working closely with the development team to understand and address security issues effectively. 
The importance of coding securely is crucial as it protects sensitive data from breaches, ensures compliance with legal and industry regulations, maintains client trust, and reduces the risk of financial and reputational damage. Secure software enhances the company's overall security posture, reduces the likelihood of costly data breaches, increases customer trust and satisfaction, and provides a competitive advantage by demonstrating a commitment to security

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The challenging part of the vulnerability assignment was understanding and mitigating complex vulnerabilities in a large and intricate codebase.
The helpful part of the vulnerability assignment was leveraging automated vulnerability scanning tools and collaborating with the development team as it provided valuable insights and facilitated effective identification and resolution of security issues.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I increased the security layers by implementing multiple layers of security, including multi-factor authentication, regular security training for developers, and continuous monitoring and logging of suspicious activities.
In the future, I plan to use automated security testing tools such as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), conduct regular penetrating testing, and adopt threat modeling to anticipate and mitigate potential security threats.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

To make certain that the code and software application were functional and secure, I conducted thorough testing of the software after implementing security fixes to ensure functionality was not compromised. The usage of automated testing tools to check for new vulnerabilities was introduced during the refactoring process. Peer reviews and audits should be conducted to verify the robustness and security of the code as well.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Resources that were used that may be helpful in future assignments or tasks would be OWASP guidelines for secure coding practices, security scanners such as Burp Suite and SonarQube to identify vulnerabilities, and coding standards to use code review checklists in order to ensure best practices are followed.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?****

Some examples that could be shown to future employers would be assessment reports that are detailed reports highlighting identified vulnerabilities, their impact, and the mitigation techniques applied, and comprehensive documentation of the security improvements made and their benefits to the company's overall security posture
